SMS (Sms Management Suite)
==========================

Manager for mobile messages in computer. Takes .vmg messages as input and converts them to single-file nice-looking conversation per contact. Output file format is html, so can be viewed across all operating systems and browsers (including mobile!).

Details
-------
Currently supports only text messages stored as `.vmg` files. These messages can be exported from phone using Nokia PC Suite, or can be extracted from backup using NBUexplorer application (an open source application hosted on SourceForge). 

Requirements
------------
1. A Linux machine
2. Python installed (I think any 2.0+ version will do the job)

How to use
----------

    ./src/smsInit.py

This will create `to_process`, `processed`, `meta`, `conversations` and `unprocessed` directories. You need to put all your .vmg files in `to_process` folder which will be moved to `processed` folder after processing. All the output conversation html files will go into `conversations` folder. Then execute:

    ./src/sms.py

And you are done! Check `conversations` folder to see the conversation files.

Issues and Future Development
-----------------------------
In the increasing order of labour:

1. Providing support for .csv sms-message files generated by Nokia PC Suite.
2. Support for Samsung, LG, Android, etc messages
3. Cross-platform application (specifically Windows)
4. Develop a cool GUI for the application (preferably in GTK)
5. Develop message viewing/scrolling/finding/selectively saving abilities in the GUI.
5. Develop python independent binary executables (using something like PyGtk or PyInstaller.
